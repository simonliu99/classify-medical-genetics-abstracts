# Classification of Medical Genetics Abstracts

## Summary
Deep learning is emerging as a powerful tool in multiple biomedical areas, especially in genetics and genomics. This project is an attempt to automate the annotation of new abstracts as relevant to deep learning in genetics.

## Data
All abstract information were queried from the National Library of Medicine's [PubMed citation database](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) using the [Entrez Direct (EDirect)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK179288/) utilities.

The raw data files were not included in this repository due to size constraints, but they can be regenerated by running the `pubmed-curate.ipynb` and `pubmed-features.ipynb` notebooks sequentially. This does require EDirect to be installed on your system, the instructions for which can be found [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK179288/).

## Code
This code was run on `Python 3.8.12` due to certain package compatibility issues. All required packages are listed in the `requirements.txt` file, which can be installed with the command `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

Sample training scripts for the `RandomForestClassifier` and `BertForDocumentClassification` are included in the `scripts/` folder. BERT training will realistically require a CUDA-enabled GPU system. The `pubmed-snorkel.ipynb` notebook will not run properly if the data regeneration steps above are not followed.
